[<img src="http://www.wordpressdocker.com/imgs/devoply.png">](http://www.devoply.com/)

A bit of shameless self-promotion. We are building a freemium Docker hosting control panel which does everything taught in this tutorial automatically and much more, backups, staging/dev/prod, code editor, Github/Bitbucket deployments, DNS, **WordPress Management like ManageWP**, etc. For example deploy 10 WordPress sites on a $5 Digital Ocean Droplet in around 10 minutes. Save $95 compared to WPEngine!. Sign up at [http://www.devoply.com](http://www.devoply.com) and make your life much easier!
